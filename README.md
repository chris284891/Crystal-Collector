# Crystal Collector
This is a memory and math game.

# Problem
Make a game where the user has to click on four different buttons to add up random numbers to match a bigger random number. User chosen numbers have to be hidden and all numbers must change after each round.

# Solution
Made two different arrays of all numbers to be used. Made random number generater for both arrays. Assigned returned numbers to user buttons and goal score. Used if statements for when goal score is reached and logged wins/losses.

# Tech
- Arrays
- onclick functions
- math.random
- JQuery
- parseInt

# Instructions
You will be given a random number at the start of the game. There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score. You win the game by matching your total score to a random number. You lose the game if your total score goes above the random number. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it. Each time the game starts, the values of each crystal will change.
